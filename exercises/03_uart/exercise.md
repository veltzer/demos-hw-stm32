# UART Communication

This exercise involves sending and receiving data over the UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) to a computer. A good starting point is to have the board send a "Button Pressed!" message to a serial terminal on your PC when you press a button.

What you'll learn: You'll dive into peripheral communication. This involves configuring the UART peripheral, including setting the baud rate, word length, and parity. You'll learn how to transmit and receive data, which is essential for debugging and interfacing with other devices. The NUCLEO board's integrated ST-LINK provides a virtual COM port, making this easy to set up.
