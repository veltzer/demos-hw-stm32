# Push-Button Input to Control LEDs

This exercise introduces the concept of input. The goal is to make an LED turn on or change its state only when the user push-button (B1, B2, or B3) is pressed.

What you'll learn: You'll learn how to configure a GPIO pin as an input and how to read its state. This introduces the fundamental concept of polling, where you continuously check the button's status in a loop. It's a foundational step for creating interactive devices.
